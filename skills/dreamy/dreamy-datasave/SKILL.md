# Dreamy Datasave

## Purpose

Protect player-owned state through explicit schema, transaction, migration, and save timing decisions.

## When To Use

- The task changes, reviews, debugs, or plans behavior in this domain.
- Nearby code already implements this domain and the change can alter ownership, lifecycle, data, assets, platform behavior, or verification.
- A review/debugging/planning task needs this domain's decision model or failure modes.

## When Not To Use

- A narrower skill owns the concrete behavior more directly.
- The request is documentation-only and does not make domain, API, or verification claims.
- The project lacks the package or platform and the task is not about detection, fallback, or migration.

## Domain Model

Save envelope -> data version -> stable IDs -> load/migrate -> transaction mutation -> persist/backup -> recovery path.

## Required Inspection

- Project `AGENTS.md` when present, local instructions, nearby code owners, tests, and recent diffs.
- Unity projects: `Packages/manifest.json`, `Packages/packages-lock.json`, asmdefs, scenes/prefabs/assets relevant to this domain.
- Compatibility catalogs before Dreamy, Unity-package, or third-party API claims.
- Existing runtime owner, persistence owner, UI/presenter owner, asset owner, and lifecycle cleanup path.

## Decision Tree

- Persistent currency, inventory, settings, unit level, and claim state belong in Datasave.
- Definitions, prices, weights, and tuning do not belong in Datasave.
- Schema change requires version and migration.
- External transaction requires processed transaction ID/idempotency.
- If the owner is unclear, stop at a plan/architecture decision before mutating code.

## Workflow

1. Inspect current owner and existing project convention.
2. Map static config, persistent state, runtime state, UI, service, asset, and lifecycle ownership where applicable.
3. Choose the smallest change that preserves architecture, serialization, and dependency direction.
4. Add or update focused tests/fixtures when behavior, migration, or lifecycle risk changes.
5. Run compile, console, targeted tests, harness/static validation, or record the exact unavailable gate.
6. Review diff for unrelated churn and unsupported API claims.

## Architecture Rules

- Keep Runtime assemblies free of Editor references.
- Keep DataConfig, Datasave, runtime state, UI, and service responsibilities separate.
- Resolve global services at roots/high-level owners; pass explicit dependencies to leaves.
- Preserve `.meta` GUIDs, serialized references, prefab overrides, and package dependency direction.
- Optimize only from measured evidence.

## Common Patterns

- Save after meaningful transactions and app pause, not every frame.
- Persist stable IDs rather than UnityEngine.Object references.
- Handle first install, missing file, corrupt primary, old version, future version.

## Anti-patterns

- Silent data loss on migration.
- Duplicate purchase because transaction ID was not persisted.
- Future-version save overwritten by older client.

## Common Failure Modes

- Unsupported or drifted API claim.
- Hidden owner change between package, project, UI, runtime state, or persistence.
- Lifecycle leak through async work, events, tweens, pooled objects, Addressables handles, or scene transitions.
- Verification skipped without a precise degraded reason.

## Verification

- Compile/console/test result when Unity is available, otherwise degraded harness/static evidence with exact reason.
- Focused regression for duplicate calls, cancellation/destruction, save/load, migration, or platform branch when relevant.
- Diff review for serialization, `.meta`, asmdef/manifest, scene/prefab, and unrelated changes.

## Dreamy Integration

- Inspect Dreamy package compatibility before using package APIs.
- Keep observed facts, intended contracts, and unresolved hypotheses separate.
- Route project-specific glue to project code and reusable capability to package/shared ownership only when dependency direction is clean.

## Allowed Claims

Dreamy package APIs are allowed only when backed by `compatibility/dreamy-packages.json` and not listed as drift or unsupported.

## References

- Read project `AGENTS.md` and `rules/index.json` when present; for global installs, use the packaged skill/rule context and relevant compatibility catalog before making ownership or API claims.
- Read `references/migration.md` when the task touches this skill's deeper migration behavior.
- Read `references/transactions.md` when the task touches this skill's deeper transactions behavior.
- Read `references/corruption-recovery.md` when the task touches this skill's deeper corruption recovery behavior.
